# Time, States, and the Human Experience: A Reflection

Lately, my mind has been revolving around the concept of the world as a vast state machine, a notion that emerged from my studies on the Church-Turing Thesis. This premise paints a picture of people navigating their lives through a series of states, transitioning between these states as they engage in various tasks and activities.

However, the state of the world is not stagnant. It's in constant flux, reshaped by countless variables and happenings. One might then wonder, is our world advancing? This question arises from the realization that each new discovery, each academic paper, each achievement only alters our perception of the world rather than its inherent state. These milestones could be perceived as shifts in the collective human state, grounded on the past and fueling progress.

Yet, unlike time, these states can be revisited. We can return to old checkpoints and adjust our course if necessary. Conversely, the inexorable march of time allows for no such luxury. We can't rewind our years, reclaim our youth, or retreat to a state of innocence. Our actions in the continuum of time, whether they propel the "world state machine" forward or revert it, generate tangible and intangible rewards such as wealth, reputation, memories, and relationships. However, if human existence is viewed as a state in itself, these gains could seem insignificant.

The endeavor of changing the world, whether by pushing it forward or pulling it back, has inherent value to humans. It gives rise to winners and losers, the prosperous and the impoverished. As a youth, my dream was to change the world. I realize now that I sought to impact the lives of people, to enrich their experiences and inspire them.

With this perspective, the world state remains unaltered from birth to death. We, as humans, are but transient inhabitants, leaving our mark on the world through structures and discoveries. Yet, these marks are for us alone. They emerge from existing resources, transforming from unseen to discovered states, leaving the world fundamentally unaltered.

Looking back over the past two millennia, humanity has been in a cyclical pursuit of shaping the world and earning memories, relationships, and reputations. It's clear that we cannot change the world itself; our influence extends only to its inhabitants. And since each individual possesses a unique brain, memory, and mindset, influencing them is no easy task.

Society operates on this understanding. There is a state machine within each human brain, signifying their life path. We can revisit these states through memory, introspection, and learning, constantly powering up our brain. And perhaps, in death, we may find a peace of mind detached from worldly acquisitions and grounded in our internal state machine.

Yet, achieving this peace is a challenge. Humans naturally prioritize their survival and the well-being of their loved ones. This self-centered nature, propelled by our temporal boundaries, often leads to actions detrimental to others. Time, in its relentless progression, makes us emotional and treasure our lives and loved ones.

Thus, understanding that the state machine of your mind is the only constant amidst life's unpredictable course can provide a profound sense of peace. Such tranquility isn't tied to material wealth but is related to what you manage to hold on to throughout your life. The crux of these musings points to a truth many of us forget â€“ that in the end, peace of mind and contentment do not stem from what we gain but rather from what we don't lose.
